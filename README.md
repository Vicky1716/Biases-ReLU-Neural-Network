# Biases-ReLU-Neural-Network
Here we present the biases ReLU Neural Network (BReLU NN), and gives the implementation code on Tensorflow and Pytorch, respectively.
The BReLU NN was proposed by Xinglong.Liang in 2020, and was applied in many fields, such as prediction of building energy consumption and traffic signal control problem.
